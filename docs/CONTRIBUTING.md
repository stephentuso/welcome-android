Pull Requests
-------------

All pull requests are welcome, base them on the `dev` branch, it has the latest code.

If new methods or classes are added, unit tests would be appreciated. Local tests are located in the library module in `/src/test/`. Instrumented tests are currently in the sample module in `/src/androidTest/`.

Private resources are in `res`, and should be prefixed with `wel_`. Public resources are in `res-public` and have no prefix.
